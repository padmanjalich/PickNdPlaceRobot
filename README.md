# Robot Simulation with Pybullet

## Project Description

This project provides practical experience in simulating and programming robots using the Pybullet physics simulation library. The primary objective is to apply forward and inverse kinematics algorithms within a simulated environment. The project involves setting up a Python environment with Pybullet, loading objects, and recording tray locations to ensure correct object positioning.

## Objectives

- Simulate a robot arm using Pybullet.
- Apply forward and inverse kinematics algorithms.
- Plan and execute precise actions for object manipulation.

## Project Workflow

1. **Setup:**
   - Install Pybullet and set up a Python environment.

2. **Simulation:**
   - Load assigned objects and record tray locations.
   - Ensure objects are positioned correctly.

3. **Execution:**
   - Plan and execute a sequence of precise actions for the robot arm.
   - Actions include:
     - Approaching an object.
     - Accurately grasping the object.
     - Lifting and moving the object.
     - Releasing the object onto a tray.

4. **Kinematics:**
   - Use forward and inverse kinematic functions.
   - Control hand direction to achieve the desired results.

## Key Learnings

- Gain insights into intelligent robot programming and simulation.
- Familiarize with essential tools and techniques for robot simulation.
- Apply kinematics in simulation environments.
